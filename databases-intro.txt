2. Explain when a database would be used. Explain when a text file would be used.
    a. A database is used when you need to be able to easily search for specific data
        and access that data with multiple applications simultaneously. A text file would be used
        when you simply need data to persist after the end of a program, and you want that data
        to be easily readable by humans.

3. Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.
    a. One major difference between SQL and other programming languages is
        that SQL is declarative rather than procedural. This means it is more
        concerned about what we want to find out rather than the process of finding it.

4. In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.
    a. In a database, data is stored in binary file format, which cannot be read by humans.
        This data is can then be accessed and manipulated using the SQL database language.

5. Explain the meaning of table, row, column and value.
    a. table - databases display data using a table structure to organize it.
        these tables consist of rows, columns and values.
    b. row - rows in a database represent a complete unit of data, including all of the
        columns with values that are properties of that unit.
    c. column - columns in a database define what the data represents.
    d. value - values in databases contain the information that the column header
        describes.

6. List three data types that can be used in a table.
    a. Dates
    b. Numeric values
    c. Strings

7. Given this payments table, provide an English description of the following queries
    and include their results:
    a.

    SELECT date, amount
     FROM payments;

        This query selects both the date and amount columns from the payments table.
        The results would be as follows:

Date		Amount
5/1/2016	1500.00
5/10/2016   37.00
5/15/2016	124.93
5/23/2016	54.72

    b.

    SELECT amount
    FROM payments
    WHERE amount > 500;

    This query selects the amount column from the payments table only
    where the amount is greater than 500. The results would be as follows:

    Amount
	1500.00

    c.

     SELECT *
     FROM payments
     WHERE payee = 'Mega Foods';

     This query selects all columns from the payments table where the
     payee is equal to Mega Foods. The results would be as follows.

     Date	Payee	Amount	Memo
5/15/2016	Mega Foods	124.93	Groceries

8. Given this users table, write SQL queries using the following criteria
and include the output:

    a. The email and sign-up date for the user named DeAndre Data.

        SELECT email, signup
        FROM users
        WHERE name = DeAndre Data

        email	            signup
        datad@comcast.net	2008-01-20

    b. The user ID for the user with email 'aleesia.algorithm@uw.edu'

        SELECT userID
        FROM users
        WHERE email = 'aleesia.algorithm@uw.edu'

        userid
        1

    c. All the columns for the user ID equal to 4.

        SELECT *
        FROM users
        WHERE userid = 4

        userid  name            email               signup
        4	    Brandy Boolean	bboolean@nasa.gov	1999-10-15
